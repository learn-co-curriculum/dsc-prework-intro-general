# Welcome to Flatiron School

Welcome to Flatiron School! We're thrilled that you've joined our community of
learners! In this lesson, we want to talk about the Learn platform and
philosophy.

The Learn platform is designed for people who are passionate, curious,
self-driven, and serious about learning.

We are comrades in a never-ending quest for knowledge. While there are no
shortcuts, we believe that by providing knowledge in an optimized order,
reinforcing knowledge with hands-on, feedback driven practice, and providing
space for discussion, you will learn quickly. Learn is Flatiron School's
framework for delivering that experience to you. Our goal is to provide the
right materials, support and structure _you_ need to discover your own love for
the code.

## Building a Foundation

This is the beginning of the Data Science immersive, where you will go
through everything from the basics of python to building a polished data science
project incorporating all aspects of the data cycle,

So, where do we start? How do we know what is necessary to understand _first?_
In this course, we're going to start with a simple idea - data analysis is like
having a conversation, and just like learning to talk, we need to start by
learning a few words and practicing them.

Typically when learning something about code, you have to first deal with configuring your
computer, getting it set up to work with the programming language you're writing
in. This is often referred to as _setting up your environment_. You _will_ have
to do this eventually, but for now, Learn will provide the environment you need
to get started. Learn will give you a place to code. You get to focus on coding,
not setup.

Many people on Learn have already spent some time dabbling with coding and data analysis
by using the amazing and plentiful resources all around the internet. In developing the
content here on Learn, though, we make no assumptions about background. This prework content is
designed for those who . Lessons build off each other, providing the
tools and concepts necessary to complete future lessons.

What we don't do, however, is dumb anything down. We believe in your infinite
capacity to learn. We do our best to offer a curriculum that is clear,
digestible, engaging, challenging, and deep. The curriculum you'll encounter on
Learn is rigorous and will demand that you be patient, resourceful, and gritty.

From the beginning, we'll make sure you have the support and tools you need;
you just need to bring the grit.

## The Learn Community

We don't believe in learning alone. As you make progress, expect to bump into
other learners just like you, ready and willing to help each other succeed.
Together, we can go further than we could ever go alone. We expect everyone on
Learn to be friendly, respectful, helpful, and nice. Learn is something special.

If you get stuck following the instructions, ask! If you get stuck getting a
coding concept, ask! Instructors from the community will be glad to help. There
is an ['Ask a Question'][aaq] button in all lessons on [Learn.co][learn] for
this reason, and we'll talk a bit more about this soon. You can also see
questions from other students who may be working on similar problems.
